        <h1>KEY TECHNOLOGIES BEHIND SELF-DRIVING CARS</h1>

                <h2>Sensors and Cameras</h2>
                <p>Autonomous vehicles are equipped with an array of sensors and cameras that capture real-time, high-resolution data from their surroundings. Cameras monitor visible light to detect road signs, traffic signals, and moving objects like pedestrians and other vehicles. Sensors, including ultrasonic and infrared, complement this data with information about proximity and speed, enabling a 360-degree view crucial for safe navigation.</p>
                <h2>Radar and LiDAR</h2>
                <p>Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging) and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technologies are pivotal for measuring distances and creating precise maps of the environment. Radar uses radio waves to detect objects and determine their velocity and angle relative to the vehicle. LiDAR, on the other hand, uses laser beams to produce detailed 3D maps of the vehicle’s surroundings. These maps are essential for identifying lane boundaries and obstacles, even in low visibility conditions.</p>
                <h2>AI and Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>AI and machine learning form the brain of autonomous vehicles, processing data from sensors and cameras to make informed driving decisions. Machine learning algorithms analyze historical and real-time data to predict the actions of other road users and make instant decisions on navigation and obstacle avoidance. This AI framework enables the vehicle to learn from past experiences and improve its responses over time, enhancing safety and efficiency.</p>
                <h2>Control Systems</h2>
                <p>Control systems in autonomous vehicles include a network of actuators that manage physical operations such as steering, acceleration, and braking. These systems receive signals from the vehicle’s AI brain, which are translated into mechanical actions to maneuver the vehicle. Advanced control systems can adjust these actions in milliseconds to respond to dynamic road conditions, ensuring smooth and safe travel.</p>
