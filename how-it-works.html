        <h1 style="text-align: center;">HOW DO SELF-DRIVING AUTOMOBILES WORK?</h1>
        <div id="part-2-inner">
            <div style="background-color: #99CCFF;">
                <p>The operation of self-driving automobiles is founded on the principle of perception, decision making, and actuation. First, an array of sensors, including LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), radar, cameras, and ultrasonic sensors, collect real-time data about the vehicle's surroundings. This data is then processed to create a dynamic map of the environment, identifying obstacles, road markings, traffic signs, and other vehicles.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="background-color: #3399FF;">
                <p>Advanced algorithms and AI interpret this data to make decisions on navigating roads, avoiding obstacles, and obeying traffic laws. These decisions are executed through the vehicle's control systems, managing steering, acceleration, and braking. Continuous learning and adaptation are facilitated through machine learning, allowing the vehicle to improve its driving strategies over time.</p>
            </div>
            <div style="background-color: #6699CC;">
                <p>Autonomous vehicles heavily rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which are key components of their AI systems. DNNs process environmental data captured by the vehicleâ€™s sensors to recognize patterns and make driving decisions. These networks are trained on extensive datasets containing various driving scenarios, enabling them to predict and react to potential hazards with high accuracy. Over time, as these vehicles gather more data, their algorithms are updated to enhance decision-making capabilities and adapt to new situations, thus improving safety and efficiency on the road.</p>
